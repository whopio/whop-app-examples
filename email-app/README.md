This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, add your environment variables. There is an example file with the required variables: `.env.local.example`

Now, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run whop-proxy
# or
yarn whop-proxy
# or
pnpm whop-proxy
```

Open the app on your Whop dashboard and you will be able to see the app running.
